        "info": "Pearl Jam's debut album Ten represents a cornerstone of early 1990s rock music, encapsulating the raw energy and emotive depth of the grunge movement. Released in 1991, the album features a lineup of highly talented musicians. Jeff Ament on bass, Walter Gray on cello, Dave Krusen on drums, Stone Gossard on guitar, and Mike McCready on lead guitar form the instrumental backbone, while Eddie Vedder adds a profound layer of introspection and intensity with his distinctive vocals and poignant lyrics. Additional musical contributions come from Tim Palmer, who plays unconventional instruments like a fire extinguisher and shaker (pepper), enhancing the album's unique soundscape. Rick Parashar, besides producing the album, plays piano, organ, and additional percussion, further enriching the musical texture. Production of the album was a collaborative effort between Pearl Jam and Rick Parashar, ensuring a cohesive vision. The engineering team included Adrian Moore, Dave Hills, and Don Gilmore. Management was handled by Kelly Curtis, with mastering by Bob Ludwig and mixing by Tim Palmer. Michael Goldstone served as the A and R representative, Don Mueller as the agent, and Richard Leher as the attorney. Recording took place at London Bridge Studios in Seattle, USA, during March and April of 1991. The mixing process was conducted at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, England, in June 1991. Finally, the album was mastered at Masterdisk in New York, USA.",

        "info": "Pearl Jam's fifth album Yield, released in 1998, continues the band's exploration of rock music with a refined and powerful sound. The album features Mike McCready on guitar, Stone Gossard on guitar, Ed Vedder on vocals and guitar, Jeff Ament on bass, and Jack Irons on drums. Produced by Brendan O'Brien and Pearl Jam, the album benefits from their experienced touch. Brendan O'Brien also handled most of the mixing, except for the track Push Me, Pull Me, which was mixed by Nick DiDia. Recording was managed by Nick DiDia with additional engineering by Matt Bayles. The album was recorded and mixed at Studio Litho and Studio X in Seattle, as well as Southern Tracks Recording and Doppler in Atlanta. Second engineering support was provided by Matt Bayles at Studio Litho, Sam Hofstedt at Studio X, and Ryan Williams at Southern Tracks. Mastering was completed at Rodney Mills' Masterhouse, ensuring the final sound quality was top-notch. Yield showcases Pearl Jam's continued evolution and maturity as a band.",

        "info": "Years before success led them to become one of the biggest bands in the world, a group called Mookie Blaylock took the stage at a small club in Seattle on a cold October night. The Off Ramp Cafe (which is now gone) was situated in a weird, semi-desolate block in what was then a sleepier, dirtier city - a dank northwestern outpost of day laborers, lumberjacks and jet mechanics. But this show, on Oct. 22, 1990, was a direct precursor to the grunge explosion. Soon after, the band changed their name to Pearl Jam and began their jump to the forefront of mainstream culture. 'Girl' hasn't appeared on a setlist since this show. Supporting bands: Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babies (who later became Green Apple Quickstep) and Bathtub Gin. Even Flow was played as soundcheck. A historic concert.",

Portland Oregonian: ''The whole house was going berserk, with a couple people stage-diving near the end. Humidity was 100 percent, and the temperature seemed to hit triple digits, but much of the mania was helped along by the wild antics and herky-jerky movements of everyone in the band, especially Vedder, who at various times swung from the lights above the drummer, or climbed atop a nearby speaker column, or toppled flat on his face''. Check out the setlist scan with ''prompts'' written to the left of the song list (eg: b-ball), apparently there to remind Eddie of the between song ''impromptu'' banter. He spoke of the Portland Trailblazers, Seattle Sonics and more.",

This is also Dave Abbruzzese's first concert drumming with Pearl Jam and the last show of the free ''91 Sounds of Seattle'' concert series (later called ''Pain in the Grass''). As an intro to ''Porch'', Eddie says, ''This song is about if you love someone, tell him''. Eddie climbs the speaker stacks during ''Porch'' and glances over his shoulder at the Space Needle. Eddie takes Jeff's basketball from behind the speakers and throws it playfully into the crowd. The ball makes its way back to the stage during ''Breath'', which is played wonderfully. ''Jeremy'' is on the setlist but not played. After the show the band held an ''exclusive first-listen preview party'' for Ten at the Phantom nightclub, across Fifth Avenue North from where the Museum of Pop Culture stands now.",

During ''Even Flow'', Eddie gets disgusted and flings the mic to the floor, choosing to bellow out the lyrics unaided. He can tell people in the back can't hear him though, so he quickly picks it back up. A capella version of Fugazi's ''Suggestion''. Eddie stands on a monitor and then tumbles into the audience during ''Alive''. ''Garden'' starts, and after the first verse Eddie sees a fight in the first row and breaks it up, then sings the second verse from down on the floor, which seems to calm people down. Then he says, ''All right I'll trust you guys to be friends'', and climbs back up on stage. Eddie suddenly jumps into the crowd again during ''Jeremy'', probably to break up another fight, since three crew members pile in after him. After ''Why Go'', Eddie quips, ''I'm out of breath and Mike's out of clothes''. Someone in the front hands Eddie a home-made stickman T-shirt. Eddie says, ''This thing, gentlemen, is illegal'', and then laughs. ''Who did this? We love it''. Eddie is holding it up for the audience to see and Jeff comes over to get a better look at it. Eddie says, ''Pretty good job!'' and Jeff is smiling and seems to agree. ''I think he's gettin' better than you, Jeff''. Eddie reads the tag, ''100% cotton'', shrugs and smiles. The mood lightens up a bit, and Eddie climbs like a maniac during ''Porch''. The end of the song is sung from the rafters. ''I've Got a Feeling'' is a long, jammy version, with Mike adding Hendrix bits and Eddie improvising lyrics.",

This showcase show also featured Spinal Tap, Alice in Chains, Screaming Jets, Soundgarden and Thunder. A ''special surprise guest'' (rumored to be Metallica) was supposed to play, but it was announced that there was a mix up but the night wasn't over and, ''... so the Seattle theme continues... ladies and gentlemen, Temple of the Dog!''. Now the crowd has dwindled to only 500 people, but three songs are performed: ''Hunger Strike'', ''Reach Down'' and ''Pushin Forward Back'', together with Jerry Cantrell.",

I feel like... it's just like a big movie, and I'm looking out at all you guys and it just looks like a big theater. It looks really boring. So if you feel like standing up and moving around or something, do it up''. ''Once'' is powerful and energetic, getting a few on their feet (''Feels good!'' Eddie yells during the first verse). To those who may be uninformed, Eddie says ''So tonight we're the representative band from Seattle. You got Chicago (Smashing Pumpkins), you got Hollywood (Red Hot Chili Peppers). It's a beautiful night, this is Seattle'' leading into ''Even Flow''. On the finale, ''Porch,'' Eddie jumps down into the audience, bringing eight fans up on stage for a wild, dancing climax.",
